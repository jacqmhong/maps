# Maps
Maps is a project that intends to instill lessons on some core Python features (list comprehension, zip, etc.), data abstraction, unsupervised learning (k-means), and supervised learning (linear regression). The Yelp academic dataset is used in this project with the end result being a predictor of a user's ratings for restaurants.

Only the files that resulted in editing are included:
* utils.py: using list comprehension, min, and zip
* abstractions.py: use of data abstraction
* recommend.py: unsupervised (k-means) and supervised (linear regression) learning
