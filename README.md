# Maps
Maps is a project that intends to instill lessons on some core Python features (list comprehension, zip, etc.), data abstraction, unsupervised learning (k-means), and supervised learning (linear regression). The Yelp academic dataset is used in this project with the end result being a predictor of a user's ratings for restaurants.

Only the files that resulted in editing are included:
* utils.py
* abstractions.py
* recommend.py
